# AN-INVESTIGATION-OF-FEATURE-SELECTION-METHODS-FOR-MACHINE-LEARNING-


In the current era of big data, a multitude of fields, including medical, geological,
financial, and social media, are regarded as sources of data. With the growing
significance of data, an increasing number of organisations are generating a vast
amount of data on a daily basis. One of the pivotal challenges in statistical science is
to comprehend the interrelationships between multivariate data sets in the context of
big data analysis. These relationships have been developed through the utilisation of
applied statistical methods in a broad sense. The objective is to analyse the current
situation by utilising the existing data, predict the features of future data and their
relations with each other.
Due to the nature of high-dimensional data obtained from real-life scenarios,
issues such as the lack of correlation between the features and the target variable, high
correlation between the features, the number of observations being less than the
number of features, or the number of features being so high that interpretation is
hindered, may arise. These circumstances give rise to a number of negative
consequences, including bias, a lack of interpretability, an increase in workload and a
loss of time. In light of this, shrinkage and feature selection methods have been
developed.
Feature selection methods relate to the identification of which features will be
included in the model, while shrinkage is concerned with the reduction of coefficients
(punishment) within the model. These methods have the effect of reducing the
computation time, improving the learning performance, providing a better
understanding of the learning model or data, and offering an effective solution to the
over-fitting problem.
Feature selection is categorized as Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-supervised, and
Reinforcement Learning based. Each category is subdivided into four subcategories:
Filter, Wrapper, Embedded, and Hybrid. In this thesis, Filter, Wrapper and Embedded
approaches created as Supervised Learning scenarios are discussed.
This thesis applies feature selection methods appropriate for the type of features
and target variable to four different real medical data sets. The 10-fold cross
validation prediction performances were compared by applying the most commonly
used machine learning methods. The analysis was conducted using the R
programming language
